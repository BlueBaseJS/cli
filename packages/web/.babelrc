// We use the .babelrc here to help transpile our tools and support tooling
// (such as testing libs).
// I would recommend that you keep this file in feature parity with
// the config/babelConfigResolver. That way you get to use the same level of
// javascript syntax across the entire project.
// It's nice not having to worry/think about what level of javascript syntax
// is supported for each context.
